## Quiz-App

UC Berkeley Extension Assignment #4

This project has used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I first created the starting and endning pages' layout with HTML,
then using CSS to apply style to the pages.

After creating the pages' layout, I used Javascript to render quiz questions and collect user data, and also generate response and score based on collected user data.

Please take time to review and give recommandation.
